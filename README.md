Apache container to serve static sites


**** HOW TO USE ****

1 : Place the static site files into the "public" directory

2 : If Docker is not installed in the server, run the "get-docker" script with the command 
"./get-docker.sh" using the root folder as the working dir.

3 : When Docker is installed, run the "deploy" script with "./deploy.sh". This script can be modified to customize the container settings.
